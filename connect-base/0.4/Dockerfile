#
# The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script will automatically discover the child directories
# within the $KAFKA_CONNECT_PLUGINS_DIR directory (e.g., `/kafka/connect`), and place
# all of the files in those child directories onto the Java classpath.
#
# The general recommendation is to create a separate child directory for each connector
# (e.g., "debezium-connector-mysql"), and to place that connector's JAR files 
# and other resource files in that child directory.
#
# However, use a single directory for connectors when those connectors share dependencies.
# This will prevent the classes in the shared dependencies from appearing in multiple JARs
# on the classpath, which results in arcane NoSuchMethodError exceptions.
